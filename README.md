# NLP Customer Sentiment Classifier
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction based on product reviews collected by the Public Relations department of a multinational corporation.
By analyzing the text reviews, we aim to determine whether customers are satisfied with the product or not.
This project leverages various data science techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Naive-Bayes, and Logistic Regression, to achieve this goal.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains a collection of product reviews in text format from Amazon. 
## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully predicted customer satisfaction with the product based on text reviews using a single Jupyter Notebook.
The notebook contains all the necessary code and explanations for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
